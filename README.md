# Food Product Search

Search food products with this generic search website, using [OpenFoodFacts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org) API.

This is a recreation of the first website I've built, which is horribly called as the [Unnamed Food Data Search](https://unnamed-food-data-search.netlify.app) and was built using an earlier version of SvelteKit.
